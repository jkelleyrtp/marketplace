# Amazon Marketplace Explorerer

An OpenSource app for exploring the Amazon marketplace with the Helium10 API. Used to find new product opportunities, catalog searches, and run a data-driven approach to product development.

Is currently a "LiveView" app - the server and the client are entirely the same.
